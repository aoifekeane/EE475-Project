# EE475-Project
The code written for my EE475 project: "The classification, prediction, and generation of sets in Irish traditional music"

The data and final classifier models should be available on the Google Drive as linked in supplementary material
This mainly to do with the size of the files, but if there are any problems please let me know and I can get it sorted
